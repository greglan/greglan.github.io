* Example: `proxychain firefox`  
* This will run the firefox app through proxychains.
* Possible proxies:
    - Hide My Ass!
    - SamAir Security
    - Proxy4Free
    - Hide.me
* Careful about transparent proxies, don't hide the IP address.
* Preferably Russian proxies: "EU and U.S. law enforcement do not have jurisdiction in Russia, hence little or no chance of tracing the identity" (www.hackers-arise.com)
* Proxychain config file: `/etc/proxychains.conf`  
* By default, proxychains setup to use Tor
