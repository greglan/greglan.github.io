Some pages, especially the one about computability and complexity theory might
be completed by looking at the *Quantum things* section. At the moment, this is
mainly the page about [quantum complexity theory](/quantum-complexity.html).

Future things to study and/or write about:
* Fibonacci heaps
* Red black trees
* KD trees
* [Recursivity vs Reentrancy](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9entrance)
* Add links to repo
* [Cool stuff to do](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks)
*	Lemme de l'étoile.
*	Lemme d'Arden.
*	Focntion de transition étendue.
*	Automates produits.
*	Automate racine.
