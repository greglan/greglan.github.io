## Band theory of solids
* Metals: partially filled upper band allows electrons to flow
* Insulators: completely filled upper band has no room for electrons to move
* Hole: gap left in the valence band by an electron. Move in opposite direction under electric field

## PN junction
* Semiconductor doping: change one in $$10^6$$ atoms with an excess electron (n doping) or hole (p doping)
* Direct bandgap semiconductors: conduction band (electrons) minimum is directly above the valence band (holes) minimum
  
  Photons carry a lot of energy but little momentum: electrons and holes can easily recombine to produce light providing the gap is directly above. So direct bandgap semiconductors are good light emitters
  
  Examples: GaAs, InAs

* Indirect bandgap semiconductors: conduction band minimum is displaced in momentum the valence band minimum
  
  Examples: Si, Ge, AlAs. Bandgap of Si: $$1 \mu$$m
