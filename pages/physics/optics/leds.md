![pn-junction-vs-double-heterostructure](/images/physics/pn-junction-double-heterostructure.png)

* Main advantages for LEDs:
  - high injection efficiency
  - minority carriers confined strongly to the active layer, high concentration means faster recombination
  - transparency of confining layers
* Other advantages:
  - device manufacture: etch stop layer, ohmic contacts
  - optical guidance as active layer refractive index is higher (see lasers)

## External efficiency
* Absorption losses: proportional to $$e^{- \alpha L}$$, 
  with $$\alpha$$ the absorption per meter of the material between the emission region and the surface, 
  and $$L$$ the depth of the emitter below the surface
* Total internal reflection losses: 
  associated with light hitting the interface at angles greater than the critical angle
* Fresnel losses: losses on reflection at the interface between the surface and the outside world

## Coupling with optical fibers
## Fabrication
* *Epitaxy*: to grow something layer-by-layer

### Liquid phase epitaxy
* Advantages:
  - high growth rates
  - no poisonous precursors
  - wide selection of dopants
  - flow process rather than batch process
* Disadvantages:
  - less control over thickness, alloy compositions and doping than other methods
  - reproducibility worse than other methods

### Metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD)
* Advantages:
 - Faster growth possible than e.g.
MBE
 - Flow process rather than batch
process
* Disadvantages:
  - Phosphene and other precursors are nerve gases
  - More difficult to monitor what is going on (pressure too high for electron gun to measure thickness)
  - Harder to get sharp transitions between different regions

### Molecular Beam Epitaxy
* Advantages:
  - Low growth rate ($$<1 \mu$$m/hr) leads to very fine control over layer thickness
  - Low substrate temperatures so little intermixing
  - Ultra-clean surfaces
* Disadvantages:
  - Very expensive
  - Batch process rather than flow process
  - Complicated system prone to errors
  - Requires ultra-high vacuum conditions
