## Fundamental interactions
### Introduction
* Each force mediated by a force-carrying particle: *gauge boson*
* Gauge bosons are bosons, and hence have integral spin
  
  Gauge bosons for the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions are all spin-1

  Potential graviton: spin-2 particle
* Forces emerge from the exchange of gauge bosons. For each there is an associated field whose quanta are the bosons
* Unitary groups describe the symmetries of the field. Their generators give the number of gauge bosons

### Electromagnetic force
* Symmetry group: $$U(1)$$ (unitary group)
  
  Single generator so force mediated by a single particle: photon
* Photon properties: 
  - Spin-1
  - Massless
  - Two polarization states (massless + spin-1 $$\Rightarrow$$ two polarization states)
  - No charge

### Weak force
* Gauge group: $$SU(2)$$. Three gauge bosons: $$W^+, W^-, Z$$ made up of superpositions of the generators.
* Gauge bosons properties: massive with 3 polarization states
  - $$W^+$$: mass of $$80 \text{GeV/}c^2$$, electric charge +1 
  - $$W^-$$: mass of $$80 \text{GeV/}c^2$$, electric charge -1 
  - $$Z$$: mass of $$91 \text{GeV/}c^2$$, neutral electric charge 

### Strong force
* Gauge group: $$SU(3)$$ (8 generators).
* Associated gauge bosons called *gluons*.
  
  Mediate interactions between quarks, hence responsible for binding neutron and protons together in the nucleus
* Gluons properties:
  - Spin-1
  - Massless
  - Two polarization states
  - Carry the *color* ~ charge of the strong force
* Quantum chromodynamics: theory describing the strong force
