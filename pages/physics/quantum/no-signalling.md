* Consider a system composed of two subssytems $$A$$ and $$B$$ and $$\rho$$ the
  density operator describing the entire system

  Let $$U$$ be a unitary operator and $$I$$ the identity.
* Non-sginalling property: means that the theory is consistent with relativity
* No-signalling and the partial trace: $$\tr_B(\rho) = \tr_B(I \otimes U \rho)$$

  Proof:
* A quantum operation acting on the subsystem $$B$$ cannot change the density
  operator of the subsystem $$A$$

  Consequence: no "spooky action at a distance", ok with relativity

  However, there is still a collapse after measurement on a substytem. There is
  both a collapse and the density operator remaining unchanged
