summary: "Overview of the Quantum computing industry"
---

### Riverlane
* Focused on software
* Created some kind of heterogeneous OS
* Publish papers (PRL/arxiv etc...)

### Zapata QC
* Software for QC, consultancy

### PhaseCraft
* Ashley Montanaro

### Cambridge Quantum Computing

### PsiQuantum
* Palo Alto, California
* Jeremy O’Brien, Terry Rudolph, Mark Thompson, and Pete Shadbolt
* Silicon photonic quantum computer
  
  Photons are sent down pathways placed on a silicon chip. Partially reflective mirrors bounce the photons
* GlobalFoundries (one of the world’s top chipmakers) already started producing early versions of PsiQuantum’s chips using its standard manufacturing facilities


### Nu Quantum
* Cambridge, UK. Created in 2018.
* Plans first quantum product for 2021
* Quantum optics (photons manipulations), Quantum Random Numbers Generators (QRNG)
* Achieve single-photon detection using a proprietary semiconductor structure. [Source](https://quantiki.org/position/scientist-%E2%80%93-semiconductor-devices-rd)
* [According to open positions](https://nu-quantum.com/jobs), works both on theory and experiments

### aQuantum
* R&D and consulting in quantum software
* Aims to abstract the development of quantum software
* Has its own APIs, that can talk with other popular quantum tech providers (Google, IBM, etc...)
* Based in Spain
* [Presentation](https://www.aquantum.es/aquantum-presents-quantumpath/)

### Google


### Q-CTRL

### Rigetti


### IBM

### Honeywell
