# Basic exploitation
* EIP overwrite
* NOP sled usage
* [Exploit wrapper in C](https://github.com/greglan/sec-tools/blob/master/shellcode_wrapper.c)
* [Bash script](https://github.com/greglan/sec-tools/blob/master/try_exploit.sh)

# Techniques
* ret2libc: used to defeat DEP protections. Use the code available in the libc to perfom desired actions
* ret2reg: use an address contained in a register and search for call instructions with that register
* ROP
