## ASLR
* ASLR: Address Space Layout Randomization. Changes esp origin at each launch of a program. Text segment may not be affected
* Controlled system-wide by `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`. Can be [enabled](https://github.com/greglan/sec-tools/blob/master/enable_ASLR.sh) or [disabled](https://github.com/greglan/sec-tools/blob/master/disable_ASLR.sh)
* Solution:
  * bruteforce
  * information leak

## Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
* NX bit on stack segment: prevent execution of shellcode.
  * NX bit: generic name
  * Intel name: XD (eXecute Disable) bit
  * AMD name: Enhanced Virus Protection (EVP)
  * ARM name: XN (eXecute Never) bit
* Solution: use existing code (ret2libc/ROP)
* Gcc flag for non executable stack: `-z execstack`
* 2 issues: some applications use self-modifying code, hardware support for non-executable pages is lacking on some architectures
* DEP on Windows since Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2003


## Stack smashing protection
* Also called stack cookie/canary
* GCC flag: `-fstack-protector`
* Solution: non stack-based vulnerabilities
* Used on Windows since Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2003


## RELocations Read Only (RELRO) [2]
* Hardens the data sections of an ELF binary/process
* Hardens ELF programs against loader memory area overwrites by having the loader mark any areas of the relocation table as read-only for any symbols resolved at load-time
* Reduces the area of possible GOT-overwrite-style memory corruption attacks
* Two mode of operations: partial RELRO and full RELRO

### Partial RELRO
* Compiler flags: `-Wl,-z,relro`, passed to the linker as `-z relro`
* ld option `-z relro`: tell the dynamic linker to defer function call
resolution to the point when the function is called (lazy binding), rather than
at load time. Lazy binding is the default
* ELF sections reordered so that the ELF internal data sections (.got, .dtors, etc.) precede the program's data sections (.data and .bss)
* Prevents the data sections from being overwritten in case of a .data or .bss overflow
* Read-only Non-PLT GOT
* GOT writeable

### Full RELRO
* Compiler flags: `-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now`, passed to the linker as `-z relro -z now`
* ld option `-z now`: tells the dynamic linker to resolve all symbols when the
program is started, or when the shared library is linked to using `dlopen`,
instead of deferring function call resolution to the point when the function is
first called (lazy binding)
* Includes the features of partial RELRO
* Entire GOT (re)mapped as read-only
* Prevents the modification of GOT entries to redirect execution flow
* Applies to .ctors, .dtors, .jcr, .dynamic and .got

## Position Independent Executables (PIE)
* Randomizes text and plt/got sections. Consequence: no static locations
* Libraries are PIC. Always randomized, even without PIE
* Solution: information leak

## SMEP/SMAP
* SMEP: Supervisor Mode Execution Protection. Used to prevent supervisor mode from unintentionally executing user-space code
* SMAP: Supervisor Mode Access Prevention. Feature of some CPU that allows supervisor mode programs to set user-space memory mappings so that access to those mappings from supervisor mode will cause a trap. Makes it harder for programs to "trick" the kernel into using instructions or data from a user-space program
* SMAP activation: CR4 control register
* Drawback of SMAP: larger kernel size and slower userspace memory accesses

## Pointer obfuscation
Some pointers stored in glibc are obfuscated via PTR_MANGLE/PTR_UNMANGLE macros internally in glibc, preventing libc function pointers from being overwritten during runtime.


## Resources, references and TODOs
* [3] ld manpage
* Bounds checking GCC extension. Principle: check that buffer accesses remain in bounds. Drawbacks: slowdown of 10 times.
* Static verification. Drawbacks: fails on complex programs, hard to implement.
* Dynamic analysis using Valgrind. Problem: not exhaustive.
* SafeSEH: Implemented since Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003
* Fortify source
* Heap protector
