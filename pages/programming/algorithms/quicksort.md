* Recursive sort of the list. Base case: empty list

# Vectors
* Reorganization of vector *v[a+1:b]* (indexes 1+1 to b included) such that the first elements are less than *x=v[a]* and the next ones greater than or equal to *x*, and *x* in the right place.
* Quicksort of a sub-vector *v[a:b]*
* Quicksort of a vector
