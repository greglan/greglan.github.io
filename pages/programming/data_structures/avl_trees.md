* Definition: for all nodes, the difference between the height of the left and right subtree is at most 1. Motivation : ensure the height of the tree is *log n* at each insert or delete operation. Ensures average complexity of *O(log n)*
* Comparison with red black trees. Use cases
* Check if BST is an AVL tree : implementation
* Left rotation, right rotation : example, implementation, complexity
* Insertion algorithm. Complexity.
* Deletion algorithm. Complexity.
