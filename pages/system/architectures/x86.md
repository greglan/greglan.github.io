## Calling convention

## Registers
### General purpose registers (registres généraux ou de travail)
* 4 16-bits registers: AX, BX, CX and DX
* Can be split in two 8-bits registers: AL/AH. AX = AL + 265*AH
* Can be extended to 32-bits: EAX, EBX, ...
* Higher 16 bits of an extended register (EAH) not directly accessible
* EXC often used as a counter in loops

### Offset registers (registres pointeurs ou d'offset)
* Contain a value representing an offset to be combined with a segment address
* 16-bits registers which can also be extended to 32-bits using the 'E' prefix
* Can't be decomposed as high or low 8-bits registers
* DI: Destination Index. Mostly used for operations on string. Usually associated
with the DS segment register (can also be used with the ES segment register).
Also used to access memory blocks.
* SI: Source Index. Used for operations on strings. Associated with the DS
segment register. Can also be used to access memory blocks.
* BP: Base Pointer. Used to access variables on the stack. Associated with the
SS segment register
* SP: Stack Pointer). Used to access the stack. Associated with the
SS segment register to point to the last element of the stack
* IP: Instruction Pointer. Points to the next instruction to execute. Associated
with the CS segment register. Can't be directly modified. Indirectly modified by
jump instructions, subroutines and interruptions

### Segment registers
* Used to store the beginning address of a segment. 16-bits registers only.
* Address composed of two 32-bits (or 16-bits, depending on the process mode)
 parts: 1st part=segment, 2nd part=offset
* 16-bits addressing used only in real mode. In this mode the processor can't
access blocks of size greater than 16-bits
* CS: Code Segment. Points to the address of the first instruction of the program
* SS: Stack Segment. Points on the stack
* DS: Data segment. Contains the address of the beginning of the data of the
program
* ES: Extra Segment. Used by default by some block copy instructions.
Else, free usage
* FS and GS: additional segment registers. Use similar to ES

### Flag register (16-bits)

| Bit number | Code |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|               |
| 1 | CF (Carry Flag)       |
| 3 | PF (Parity Flag)      |
| 5 | AF (Auxiliary Flag)   |
| 7 | ZF (Zero Flag)        |
| 8 | SF (Sign Flag)        |


## Processor modes
### Real mode
### Protected mode
