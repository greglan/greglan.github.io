## CPU
* Socket type: must agree with the motherboard choice
* Number of cores
* Max frequency
* base frequency
* Hyper threading
* Single core performance: what does this measure ? Examples
* Multi core performance:  what does this measure ? Examples
* Dissipated power


## Graphic card
TODO

## Motherboard

## RAM
* Capacity
* Frequency: the higher the better. But how important is this ?
* Memory technology: why doest it matter ? Compatibility with the motherboard ?
* Pins: what is this ?
* CAS: the lower the better. But how important is this ?

## Storage
