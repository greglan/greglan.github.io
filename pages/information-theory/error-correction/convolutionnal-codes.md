## Introduction
* Also called treillis code. Convolution ~ filter for encoding
  
  Very flexible in terms of input and output lengths. Still a linear block code

  Mapping (treillis) between data words and codewords depend on the previous data
* Terminology: input frame size $$k$$, output frame size $$n$$

  Memory order $$m$$: max delay in any path to any output

  Memory constraint length $$u$$: total number of delay terms exluding buffering

## Resources and references
