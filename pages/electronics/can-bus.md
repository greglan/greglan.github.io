# CAN protocol

CAN: Controlled Area Network.

Acts as a broadcast network: impossible to talk to a specific nodes. The content
of the message identifies the receiver.

Operates over two wires (CAN high and CAN low) and uses differential signaling.
For a binary zero, both voltages at 2,5V. For a binary one, CAN high at 5V and
CAN low at 0V.
