This blog is a collection of things that I know or should know. Most of the
pages are meant to help me and me only. Many topics are reduced to a list of
points that I think I should know by heart. This may very well make no sense to
someone else. Also, most pages are a WIP, and are sometimes only used as a
collection of links.
