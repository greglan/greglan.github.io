* Persistency of entanglement [2, p226]: minimum number of qubits of a multi-qubits state $$\ket{\psi}$$ to measure to guarantee that $$\ket{\psi}$$ is unentangled
* Maximal connectedness [2, p226]: a multiqubit state is maximaly connected if for any two qubits there exists a sequence of single-qubit measurements on the other qubits that when performed guarantee that the two qubits end up in a maximally entangled state
