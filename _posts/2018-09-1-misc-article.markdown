title:  "Article published in MISC"
---

I published in the French security magazine [MISC](https://connect.ed-diamond.com/MISC) with a classmate. The summary of the article is available [here](https://connect.ed-diamond.com/MISC/MISC-099/Fabriquer-sa-propre-enclave-a-base-de-FPGA).


The project discussed in the article was proposed by [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/) to my university. The aim was to study the relevance of FPGAs to improve code obfuscation techniques in terms of both quality (how difficult it is to analyze the resulting code) and performance (speed of the obfuscation process and execution of the obfuscated code).
