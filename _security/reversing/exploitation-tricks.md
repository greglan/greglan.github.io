TODO: links to source files
* View instructions encoding of binary: `objdump -D -b binary -m i386 -M intel filename.bin`
* Virtual memory map in GDB: `vmmap`
* Memory map in file: `/proc/$PID/maps`
* Exploitation outside of GDB:
    * have exactly the same environment variables, otherwise the stack is shifted
    * start the debugger and program using the absolute path
* Test if a payload contains filtered bytes
